This project is a fork of "Variable Grid System" by David White of
Sprysoft.


HISTORY

Nathan Smith developed the popular "960 Grid System" [1]. Someone,
possibly David White, made a derivative of that called Variable Grid
System (VGS) which allows for choosing an arbitrary number of columns,
choosing the column width, & choosing the gutter width. David White
created a Ruby on Rails application to generate the CSS file for VGS
based on user input of the three parameters. The code for that site was
hosted on github [2]. Note that I believe the code was updated in the
application to improve the clearfix CSS and modify the push_* and
pull_* classes, but the changes were not committed to this project. The
application was hosted at a series of URLs [3-5]. The final site [5] has
now been broken for several months.


PLAN

I want to produce a replacement for the application to generates VGS CSS
files from the command line. As I am a Perl developer, the replacement
will be a Perl script. To hopefully make this more generally useful, I
plan to commit versions at the following milestones:

(1) Replicate the CSS files produced by the code in the repository

(2) Update the script to match the output of the hosted application c.
    Oct 2014

(3) Remove support for IE 6 & IE 7

(4) Cleanup of the generating and generated code


CAVEATS

(1) I have limited samples of the code generated by the last working
    application and no samples from the original application. I cannot
    run the code from this repository without modification. I have no
    hope of matching the white space produced exactly. The two files in
    the history directory are the files that describe the construction
    of the CSS. I have modified history/index.css.erb so that it can be
    run by erb 2.1.0. I have no hope of matching the white space
    produced exactly.

(2) The RoR application had a way to generate a fluid version of the
    CSS. I currently have no plan to address that feature.

VariableGridGenerator
=====================
Variable Grid System: http://www.spry-soft.com/grids
960 Grid System: http://960.gs

The variable_grid_generator is a Ruby on Rails plugin that dynamically generates a CSS Grid System
based on the 960 Grid System by Nathan Smith.


Example
=======

12 column grid example
stylesheet_link_tag has_grid(:grid => 12, :gutter => 10, :column => 60)

16 column grid example
stylesheet_link_tag has_grid(:grid => 16, :gutter => 10, :column => 40)

30 column grid example
stylesheet_link_tag has_grid(:grid => 30, :gutter => 10, :column => 40) 

Future Versions
===============

1. Ability to fix width of CSS template.
2. When run in production the grid file is created
3. Ability to specify a fluid grid
